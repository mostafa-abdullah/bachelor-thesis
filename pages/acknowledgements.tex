To teach is to touch a life forever. Therefore, my eternal gratitude goes to my supervisors, Dr. Caterina Urban and Marco Eilers. Thank you for your continuous support and patience, for believing in me, for always listening to and valuing my opining and for everything you have taught me. I could not have done this work without your input and contributions. \\

I would also like to express my gratitude to Prof. Peter MÃ¼ller for giving me the opportunity to be a part of his group and for trusting me to work on this work. \\

A big thank you goes to my mother, father, brother and sister for their continuous encouragement and support. You are the reason I am who I am today. \\

I would also like to thank my dear friends. The ones who were always there when I needed encouragement, and the ones who held me when I was almost breaking down. \\

Last but not least, I am grateful to the programming methodology group at ETH Zurich for welcoming me for the past six months as the youngest member in the group. \\

I am utterly grateful to all of you!
